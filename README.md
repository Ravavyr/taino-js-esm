# Taino-js ESModules Version

##NOTE: Some of this README will need to be rewritten to account for changes from the original Taino JS.

Building Single-Page applications and websites with vanilla js

Reason for the name:
Frameworks have tried to abstract away from core javascript far too much and from our point of view we just don't need that much complexity. 
Most projects all start with a basic few needs and from there they're all just branches from the original vanilla.
We simple need to create "good relatives" to vanilla js, just the Taino.

Origin of the term:
Taino is a term referring to the indigenous peoples of the carribean. It's original meaning is "relatives" and "good people" and these are considered to be part of the Arawak natives of south america and the carribean.

Initial Setup:
- Click the green "clone or download" button top right. Make sure to select the "taino_base" branch and download it.
- To run on your local machine, you will need to be running a server. 
For these steps we use Node JS => https://nodejs.org/
And run a SPA the simplest way on Node is to use Live Server => https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server
- Once downloaded use the terminal to navigate to the directory your copy of the code is in and run 
this command: live-server --port=8080 --entry-file=index.html
